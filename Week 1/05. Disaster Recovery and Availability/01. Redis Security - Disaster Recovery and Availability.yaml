  - question: Which of the following mode results in a cluster partitioning from a redis failure ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - Cluster mode
      - Sentinel mode
      - Shard mode
      - Scale mode
      - Partition mode
  - question: Replication using a Redis cluster is considered a good recovery strategy. Why is this the case?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - It allows for failover from one node to another in the event of failure.
      - Replication assures a log of previous data states among nodes.
      - It is impossible for clusters to become out of sync, so recovery is assured.
      - Loss is minimized by only losing a portion of data from a node within a cluster.
