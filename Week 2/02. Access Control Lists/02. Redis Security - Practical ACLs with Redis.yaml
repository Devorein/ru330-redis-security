  - question: Why would we disable the default Redis user in Redis 6.0?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
    options:
      - Because the default user has full permissions.
      - Because the default user exists in every initial Redis deployment.
      - Because the default user cannot run certain config commands.
      - Because disabling the default user allows remote server management.
