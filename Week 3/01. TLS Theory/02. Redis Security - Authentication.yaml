  - question: Suppose you connect to a server over a network, and the server sends you its public key. What do you now need to verify?

      - 0
    options:
      - That the public key actually belongs to the server you're connecting to, and not to an attacker.
      - That the public key has a valid, associated private key.
      - That you have the associated private key in your OS's key store.
      - That your web browser has already seen this public key.

    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - To act as a trusted third party and verify the ownership of a public key.
      - To create public-private key pairs.
      - To decrypt network communications encrypted using a public key.
      - To decide upon the specific encryption algorithms used for any given TLS connection.
